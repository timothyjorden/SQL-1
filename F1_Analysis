# For this SQL project I analyzed nearly 70 years of data related to Formula 1 racing to gain insights and assess for correlations and trends.

1. I wrote this query to gather a list of Formula 1 race winners in 2008 along with the date that they won.
SELECT dri.forename First_Name, dri.surname Last_Name, rac.Date
    FROM Formula1.drivers dri
    JOIN Formula1.results res
    ON dri.driverId = res.driverId
    
    JOIN Formula1.races rac
    ON res.raceId = rac.raceId
    
    WHERE res.position = 1
    AND rac.year = 2008;
       
2. I wrote this query to calculate the number of Formula 1 wins Lewis Hamilton has had.
SELECT COUNT(dri.forename) Lewis_Hamilton_Wins
    FROM Formula1.drivers dri
    JOIN Formula1.results res
    ON dri.driverId = res.driverId
    WHERE dri.forename = "Lewis" 
    AND dri.surname = "Hamilton" 
    AND res.position = 1;
    
3. I wrote this query to determine the average pit time of each driver.
SELECT dri.forename First_Name, dri.surname Last_Name, ROUND(AVG(pit.time),3) Average_Pit_Time_Seconds
    FROM Formula1.drivers dri
    JOIN Formula1.pitstops pit
    ON dri.driverId = pit.driverId
    GROUP BY dri.surname
    ORDER BY AVG(pit.time) ASC;
    
4. I wrote this query to view race data for the top 3 drivers at the Monaco Grand Prix over the years to assess for correlations and trends between fastest lap times, fastest lap speeds, and finishing positions.
SELECT rac.Year, res.Position, res.fastestLapTime Fastest_Lap, res.fastestLapSpeed Fastest_Speed
    FROM Formula1.results res
    JOIN Formula1.races rac
    ON res.raceId = rac.raceId
    
    WHERE position < 4
    AND rac.name = "Monaco Grand Prix"
    AND LENGTH(res.fastestLapTime) > 1 
    ORDER BY rac.year ASC;
    
5. I wrote this query to get a comprehensive list of Formula 1 races along with the country they are located in.
SELECT cir.Country, rac.Name
    FROM Formula1.circuits cir
    JOIN Formula1.races rac
    ON cir.circuitId = rac.circuitId
    GROUP BY Country;
    
6. I wrote this query to view the result status of Max Verstappen for the years he has raced in the Italian Grand Prix.
SELECT sta.Status, rac.Date
    FROM Formula1.results res
    JOIN Formula1.status sta
    ON res.statusId = sta.statusId
    
    JOIN Formula1.drivers dri
    ON dri.driverId = res.driverId
    
    JOIN Formula1.races rac
    ON rac.raceId = res.raceId
    
    WHERE dri.Forename = "Max" 
    AND dri.surname = "Verstappen"
    AND rac.name LIKE "%Italian%"
    ORDER BY rac.Date;

7. I wrote this query to determine the Formula 1 driver with the most wins and the number of times they have won.
SELECT dri.forename First_Name, dri.surname Last_Name, COUNT(res.position) Times_Won
    FROM Formula1.drivers dri 
    JOIN Formula1.results res
    ON dri.driverId = res.driverId
    
    WHERE res.position = 1
    GROUP BY dri.driverId
    ORDER BY COUNT(res.position) DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    
    
8. I wrote this query to see how many times Michael Schumacher raced at each Grand Prix.
SELECT rac.Name, COUNT(rac.name) Times_Raced
    FROM Formula1.results res
    JOIN Formula1.drivers dri
    ON res.driverId = dri.driverId
    
    JOIN Formula1.races rac
    ON rac.raceId = res.raceId
    
    WHERE dri.forename = "Michael"
    AND dri.surname = "Schumacher"
    GROUP BY rac.name;


9. I wrote this query to find out how many times Michael Schumacher won each Grand Prix.
SELECT rac.Name Race_Name, COUNT(res.position) Times_Won
    FROM Formula1.results res
    JOIN Formula1.drivers dri
    ON res.driverId = dri.driverId
    
    JOIN Formula1.races rac
    ON rac.raceId = res.raceId
    
    WHERE dri.surname = "Schumacher" AND dri.forename = "Michael"
    AND res.position = 1
    GROUP BY rac.name;
    
10. I wrote this query to view the average lap time of the Monaco Grand Prix over the past 10 years.
SELECT rac.Year, ROUND(AVG(lap.milliseconds)/1000,3) Avg_Lap_Seconds
    FROM Formula1.races rac
    JOIN Formula1.laptimes lap
    ON rac.raceId = lap.raceId
    
    WHERE rac.name = "Monaco Grand Prix"
    GROUP BY rac.year
    ORDER BY rac.year DESC
    LIMIT 10;
